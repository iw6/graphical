MightyOhm geiger counter (mightyohm.com), SenseAir CO2 sensor(CO2meter.com) serial communication with Raspberry Pi and gpio pins. Graphical representation of real time data using matplotlib + data logging. 

1. Geiger.png shows backgroung radiation data using MightyOhm monitor and RPi. This programs will also work with other computers with matplotlib installed (or RPi) via USB using a FTI Friend USB connector (Amazon.com) and modifing the script as outlined in geiger.py

2. SenseAir CO2. Room.png shows CO2 levels in a bedroom overnight and the exquisite sensitivity of this detector. 

3. The programs bme680ani.py and bme280ani.py graphically animate in real time, updated in a 12 hour period, atmospheric temperature/humidity/pressure - (and resistance for bme680). The results are shown in bme680ani.tif and bme280ani.tif
